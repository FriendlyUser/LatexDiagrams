This is a LaTeX code that generates a standalone flowchart diagram using the TikZ package. The diagram depicts a market sector classification, with six nodes representing different sectors of the market. The sectors are Healthcare, Services, Technology, Utilities, Transportation, and Financial, and they are represented by rectangular blocks with rounded corners. The blocks are connected by lines that indicate the relationship between the sectors, with arrows pointing from one block to another. The diagram also has labels for the different sectors of the market, which are positioned outside the blocks. The code uses various styles and properties to define the appearance of the nodes, lines, and labels, such as node distance, text width, fill color, line style, and font size.
