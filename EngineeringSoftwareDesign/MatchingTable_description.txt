This is a LaTeX code that creates a table of software development methodologies and visualizes their relationships using arrows.

The code includes the following packages: `tikz`, `tikzmark`, `booktabs`, `amssymb`, and `amsmath`.

The table is created using the `tabular` environment, with three columns of equal width defined by the `L` column type, which centers the contents of the column and wraps the text. The table contains five rows, with a heading row and four data rows, each consisting of two cells separated by an empty cell.

The arrows are created using TikZ within a `tikzpicture` environment. The `overlay` and `remember picture` options are used to ensure that the arrows are drawn on top of the text in the table. The arrows are drawn using the `\draw` command, with the start and end points specified using the `pic cs` coordinate system. The `shorten >=.5pt` and `shorten <=.5pt` options are used to slightly shorten the arrows to avoid overlapping with the text.

There are also several `tikzmark` commands used to mark positions in the table where the arrows should start or end.
