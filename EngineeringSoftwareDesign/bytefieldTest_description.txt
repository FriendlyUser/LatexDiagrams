This LaTeX code defines four bytefields using the `bytefield` package for typesetting binary data structures.

The first bytefield is a simple 16-bit sequence with three 4-bit boxes for "src", "dest", and "const". The second bytefield has a more complex structure, with a header section containing a 4-bit "Tag" box and a 12-bit "Mask" box, and a 16-bit "Source" box and an 8-bit "Destination" box. The third bytefield uses custom colors to represent a 32-bit floating point number using a 1-bit sign box, an 8-bit exponent box, and a 23-bit mantissa box. The fourth bytefield is a TCP header layout using various box sizes to represent different fields and headers, including a custom key-value field, a timestamp, and a 64-bit random number.
