The code is a LaTeX document that defines a standalone diagram using the TikZ package. The diagram depicts a pension scheme and the various entities involved in managing it.

The document begins with the necessary packages and settings to create the diagram, including the input encoding, TikZ library, and color definitions.

The diagram is defined using a `tikzpicture` environment with a set `node distance` of 5cm. Several styles are defined using `tikzset`, such as `connector` for the arrow styles used to connect the nodes, `rectangle connector` for the arrows that connect nodes with a right angle, and `straight connector` for the arrows that connect nodes directly.

The diagram includes several nodes, each with a specific shape, draw style, fill color, and text content. The nodes represent the company, defined benefit pension scheme, asset manager, and liability-driven investment fund. The arrows connect these nodes to show the flow of money and management.

Finally, the diagram includes four additional nodes that represent various investment options available to the fund: equities, bonds, gilts, and derivatives. These nodes are connected to the fund node using different arrow styles, and a text node is included to explain the investment options.
