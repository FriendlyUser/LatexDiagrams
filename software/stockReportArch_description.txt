This is a LaTeX code that generates a diagram using the TikZ package. The diagram consists of two rectangular modules, each containing four nodes. The first module is labeled "Data APIs" and has four nodes representing different APIs for obtaining data related to news, stocks, and exchange rates. The second module is labeled "Analysis" and has three nodes representing tools for analyzing the obtained data, including sentiment analysis, technical metrics, and generating stock price predictions. The diagram is generated using matrix nodes, and the style of each node is defined using the TikZ "draw" and "text width" commands. The overall style of the diagram is defined using the "tikzset" command, which includes the definition of the "moduleheader" style for the rectangular headers of each module.
