This is a LaTeX code that creates a simple diagram using the TikZ package. The diagram consists of a rectangle with a label at the top indicating "View Level". Inside the rectangle, there are four smaller rectangles labeled as "view 1", "view 2", "view 4", and an ellipsis symbol in between "view 2" and "view 4". Below the main rectangle, there are two smaller rectangles labeled as "Logical level" and "Physical level" with an arrow connecting them. The rectangles and the arrow are styled with different colors and dimensions using various TikZ options such as "draw", "fill", "text width", "minimum height", "minimum width", and "align". The code starts with the document class "standalone" and imports necessary packages such as TikZ, color, and inputenc.
