## Latex Diagrams
This repo contains all the diagrams I have generated for my academic career (university of victoria), for fun and referenced from stack overflow.

Willing to make custom diagrams for small fee, or even for free depending on the situation.

You can view all the diagrams at https://grandfleet.eu.org.


Recently I have published a book on tex with the help of chatgpt.
