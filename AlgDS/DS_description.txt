This LaTeX code produces a diagram using the TikZ package that depicts different categories of data structures. The diagram consists of a central node labeled "Data Structures" with four nodes branching out from it, each representing a category of data structures: Linear, NonLinear, Homogeneous, and Heterogeneous. The Linear node contains a list of linear data structures, the NonLinear node contains a list of non-linear data structures, the Homogeneous node contains a list of homogeneous data structures, and the Heterogeneous nodes contain subcategories of heterogeneous data structures each with a box that contains a list of examples of the subcategory. The diagram uses the color scheme of a purpleVue color for the text, and a double line drawn around each of the nodes to differentiate them from one another.
