The given LaTeX code generates a block diagram for a control system. It starts by defining a few variables such as `\equal` for the equal sign, and the radius of an arc over the intersection. Then it defines a style called `connect` that can be used to draw a curved line between two points. The actual diagram is created in a `tikzpicture` environment.

The diagram starts with an input block, labeled as A. A summing block is added next, labeled as B. A line is drawn with the label R(s) from A to B, indicating the input to the summing block. Block G1 is added with a gain of 2, labeled as C, and a line is drawn from B to C. Two more summing blocks are added, labeled as D and E, respectively. A branch is added from E for two blocks, H1 and G2, with G2 having a gain of 2, labeled as EH2. Block H1 is positioned above G1 using a branch. Another branch is added from G2 to block H2 with a gain of -1.5.

The other branch from E is used to add two more blocks, H2 and G3. Block H2 has a gain of -4.5 and is placed below the branch. Another summing block is added below H2, labeled as adder4, and a line is drawn from EH2 to adder4, indicating the input to adder4. Block G3 is added below adder4 with a gain of 3. The output of G3 is connected to the final block, which is labeled as C(s).

Lastly, some connections between blocks are made using lines and arrows. The `connect` style is used to draw a curved line from adder3down to E with a 3pt gap over the intersection with H2 to adder2down. A line is drawn from H2Block to adder2down, and from adder4up to adder4. The final output is connected to G3Block using an arrow, and a line is drawn from H3Block to adder3down. Finally, the last connection is made between BranEndReturn and B.
