This defines a block diagram using the "blox" package in LaTeX. The block diagram represents a control system with multiple components such as adders, blocks, and branches. The system takes an input signal represented by node "A" and processes it through various components such as $G_1$, $G_2$, $H_1$, $H_2$, $G_3$, and $H_3$ to produce an output signal represented by node "end".

The code uses various functions from the "blox" package to create the different components of the block diagram. The "\bXInput" function creates an input node, "\bXComp" creates a summing point, and "\bXBloc" creates a block with a transfer function. The "\bXLink" function is used to connect nodes and components with lines, and the "\bXBranchx" and "\bXBranchy" functions create branches in the diagram.

Also it defines a custom function called "connect" which creates an arc over a line at the intersection of two other lines. This function is used to connect components that are not directly in line with each other.
