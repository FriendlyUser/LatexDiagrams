The code above generates a block diagram using the `blox` and `tikz` packages. The diagram consists of a feedback control system. It has one input labeled "A" and one output labeled "E". The signal "A" is connected to a block labeled "B" via a line without any text. Block "B" is a summing junction, represented by the command `\bXComp`, which adds the input signal to a feedback signal that is not shown. Block "B" is connected to a block labeled "C" with the transfer function $G\_c(s)$, represented by the command `\bXBloc[2]{C}{$G_c(s)$}{B}`. Block "C" is connected to a block labeled "D" with a transfer function of $\cfrac{820}{s(s+10)(s+20)}$, represented by the command `\bXBloc[2]{D}{$\cfrac{820}{s(s+10)(s+20)}$}{C}`. Block "D" is connected to the output block "E" via a line labeled with `$C(s)$`, represented by the command `\bXLink{D}{E}`. Finally, there is a return line, represented by the command `\bXReturn{D-E}{B}{}`, that connects the output of block "D" to the summing junction "B".
