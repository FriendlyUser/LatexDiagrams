This code generates a block diagram using the TikZ package in LaTeX. The diagram has four blocks: an input block labeled "A," a comparator block labeled "B," a proportional controller block labeled "G\_c(s)," and a plant block labeled with a transfer function of $\frac{5}{s(0.5s+1)}$ and labeled "D." There are also two connection lines labeled with arrows between the blocks, one connecting "A" to "B" and the other connecting "B" to "C." There is an output block labeled "E" with an arrow connecting it to the plant block "D" and another connection line labeled with an arrow connecting the plant block "D" to the comparator block "B." Finally, there is a return line labeled with an arrow connecting the difference between "D" and "E" to the input block "B."
