The code produces a diagram of a digital control system using the TikZ package in LaTeX. The system consists of an input node, a summing node represented by a circle with a plus and minus sign, a digital filter represented by a rectangular block with the transfer function written inside, a branch point, and an output node. The diagram also includes a node labeled "m" to represent a measurement point. The arrows connecting the nodes represent the flow of signals through the system. The code also includes annotations and calculations to determine the root loci and stability of the system for different values of gain K.
