The transfer function for the given system is:
$$ H(s) = \frac{(s+z\_1)(s+z\_2)}{(s+p\_1)(s+p\_2)(s+p\_3)} $$

Where $z\_1 = -0.6958e^{j36^{\circ}},\ z\_2 = -0.6958e^{-j36^{\circ}},\ p\_1=-0.3679,\ p\_2=-0.8187,\ p\_3=-1.$

To sketch the pole-zero plot for this system, we plot the poles and zeroes of the transfer function on the complex plane.
