Here's a sample code that will produce a figure with multiple nodes in TikZ:


```
scss`\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}

\begin{document}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]
 \node (node1) [draw, circle] {Node 1};
 \node (node2) [draw, circle, right=of node1] {Node 2};
 \node (node3) [draw, rectangle, below=of node1] {Node 3};
 \node (node4) [draw, rectangle, below=of node2] {Node 4};
 \node (node5) [draw, diamond, below=of node3] {Node 5};
 \draw [->] (node1) -- (node2);
 \draw [->] (node1) -- (node3);
 \draw [->] (node2) -- (node4);
 \draw [->] (node3) -- (node5);
 \draw [->] (node4) -- (node5);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}`
```
This code will produce a figure with 5 nodes of different shapes (circles, rectangles, and a diamond) and directed edges connecting them. You can modify the shapes, colors, and positions of the nodes to suit your needs. The `node distance` parameter sets the default distance between nodes, which you can adjust as needed. The `positioning` library provides additional positioning options for nodes, such as `above=of` and `below right=of`. You can also add labels or text to nodes using the `label` or `text` parameters.
