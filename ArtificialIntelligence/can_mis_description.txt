"Missionaries and Cannibals" is a classic puzzle that involves three missionaries and three cannibals who are stranded on one side of a river. They have a small boat that can carry two people at a time. The puzzle requires them to find a way to transport all six people to the other side of the river without any of the missionaries being eaten by the cannibals.

The rules for this puzzle are:

1. The boat can carry a maximum of two people.
2. If there are ever more cannibals than missionaries on one side of the river, the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
3. All the people must reach the other side of the river to solve the puzzle.

To solve this puzzle, the following steps can be taken:

1. Start by transporting two cannibals to the other side of the river.
2. One cannibal will remain on the other side of the river, while the other will return to the original side.
3. Two missionaries will then be transported to the other side of the river.
4. One missionary will remain on the other side of the river, while the other will return to the original side.
5. Two cannibals will be transported to the other side of the river.
6. One cannibal will remain on the other side of the river, while the other will return to the original side.
7. Two missionaries will be transported to the other side of the river.
8. Finally, one cannibal and one missionary will be transported to the other side of the river.

At this point, all six people will have been transported to the other side of the river, and none of the missionaries will have been eaten by the cannibals.
