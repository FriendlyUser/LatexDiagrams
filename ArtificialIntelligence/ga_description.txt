The code above defines a simple flowchart using the TikZ package in LaTeX. The flowchart consists of several blocks representing different stages of a genetic algorithm. The blocks are defined using the \texttt{tikzstyle} command with different styles, such as \texttt{decision} and \texttt{block}. The edges between the blocks are drawn using the \texttt{line} and \texttt{path} styles. The nodes are positioned using the \texttt{positioning} TikZ library.

The flowchart starts with a block for population initialization, followed by fitness assignment, selection, crossover, mutation, and inversion. The flow then cycles back to the selection block until a termination criterion is met, at which point the algorithm finishes and reaches the final "Done" block.
