The code defines a LaTeX document of class "standalone" with the "varwidth" option. It loads the TikZ package and several TikZ libraries for positioning, chains, and shapes.

It then sets the length of a node to a specified width using `\newlength` and `\setlength`. In the TikZ environment, it sets the style of every node to a rectangle split with a draw option and a 90-degree rotation. The rectangle split is divided into 10 parts. Finally, it creates a node with a rectangle split shape and a specified minimum width and height.
