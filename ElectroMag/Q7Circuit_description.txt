This is a LaTeX code that generates an electrical circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package. The diagram represents a transformer-coupled amplifier, with various resistors and sources. The circuit consists of three resistors and three sources, two of which are current sources. The circuit also includes two transformers with a ratio of `N1:N2`. Each resistor and source is labeled with a symbol that indicates its name, current or voltage direction, resistance, and/or voltage. The colors of the resistors and sources are specified using color names. The `mathrsfs`, `latexsym`, `amssymb`, and `amsmath` packages are used to typeset the mathematical symbols and characters. The document class is set to `standalone`, which is used to generate a single image file of the circuit diagram.
