This code creates a circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package in LaTeX. The circuit diagram shows a voltage source with label $\mathscr{F} = NI$, where N and I are variables, connected in series with a resistor $\mathscr{R}\_g$. Another resistor, $0.5\mathscr{R}\_s$, is connected in parallel to the voltage source, and the two components are connected in series to a ground node at the bottom of the diagram. The voltage across the resistor $\mathscr{R}\_g$ is labeled $\mathscr{F}\_1$ and is shown in green, while the voltage across the resistor $0.5\mathscr{R}\_s$ is labeled $\mathscr{F}\_2$ and is shown in blue. A symbol $\phi$ is added next to the resistor $\mathscr{R}\_g$ and an arrow shows the direction of the current flow.
