This is a LaTeX code that creates an electronic circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package. The code defines the document class as `standalone` and then imports the necessary packages `graphicx`, `mathrsfs`, `latexsym`, `amssymb`, and `amsmath`. It also defines a new command `\equal` that represents the equals sign.

The circuit diagram consists of a voltage source on the left side, two resistors of the same value connected in series in the center, and a third resistor connected in parallel to the first two. The values of the resistors are represented by the variables `R_s` and `R_g`. The voltage source is represented by the symbol `$\mathscr{F}\equal NI$`.

The resistors are color-coded in green and blue, and the resistor in parallel is color-coded in red. The direction of the current flow in the parallel resistor is represented by the variable `$\phi$`. Two labels `$\phi_1$` and `$\phi_2$` are also added to the circuit diagram using `node`.
