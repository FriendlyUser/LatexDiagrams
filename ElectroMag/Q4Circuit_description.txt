This is a LaTeX document that generates a circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package. The circuit represents an electrical system with multiple resistors and a voltage source. The circuit consists of several components connected by wires. The circuit has three resistors, labelled as R\_l, R\_l1, and R\_l2, and one voltage source labelled as $\mathscr{F} = NI$. The circuit also includes several arrows that represent the flow of current and voltage, as well as labels to indicate the values of the different components. Finally, the diagram has a caption or title which says $\phi\_{Meme}$ and is placed at the bottom of the image.
