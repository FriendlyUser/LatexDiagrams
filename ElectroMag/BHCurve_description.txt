This LaTeX code defines a standalone document with a single `tikzpicture` environment that creates a 2D plot of a sigmoid function. The plot is created using the `pgfplots` package, and the `fillbetween` library is used to fill the area between two plots with a red!20 color.

The `axis` environment is used to set the properties of the plot, including the axis limits, labels, ticks, and line styles. The `addplot` command is used to add several plots to the axis.

Two of the added plots are dashed lines that span the entire `x` axis and have a constant `y` value of 2.5 and -2.5 respectively. The other two added plots are the sigmoid function, which is defined using mathematical expressions for `x` and `y`, and named paths `A` and `B`. The `fill between` command fills the area between the paths `A` and `B` with the specified color.
