This code generates an electrical circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package. The circuit diagram has three resistors, labeled $\mathscr{R}*{g1}$, $\mathscr{R}*{g2}$, and $\mathscr{R}*{g3}$, and three voltage sources labeled $\mathscr{F}*1$, $\mathscr{F}*2$, and $\mathscr{F}*3$. The resistors and voltage sources are arranged in a circuit such that $\mathscr{F}*1$ is connected to $\mathscr{R}*{g1}$, which is connected to $\mathscr{F}*2$, which is connected to $\mathscr{R}*{g2}$, which is connected to $\mathscr{F}*3$, which is connected to $\mathscr{R}*{g3}$. The circuit is completed by connecting $\mathscr{R}*{g3}$ to $\mathscr{R}*{g1}$ and connecting $\mathscr{R}*{g2}$ to $\mathscr{R}*{g3}$. Additionally, the diagram has two labels for the phase angles, $\phi\_1$ and $\phi\_2$, which are connected to the circuit using curved arrows.
