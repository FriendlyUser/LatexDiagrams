This LaTeX code generates a circuit diagram using the `circuitikz` package. The circuit consists of a signal generator on the left, connected to a two-port network with characteristic impedance `Z_g`. The two-port network is connected to two transmission lines with an open circuit at one end and connected to a load with characteristic impedance `Z_L` at the other end. The circuit is enclosed in a `circuitikz` environment, and the `tikzstyle` command defines the style of the rectangle-shaped `block` that is used to enclose the two-port network in the diagram.
