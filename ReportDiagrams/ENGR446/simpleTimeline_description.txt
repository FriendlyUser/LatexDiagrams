This is a LaTeX code for a timeline diagram created using the TikZ package. The document class is set to standalone with a font size of 6pt. The TikZ library "snakes" is also used in this code. The timeline is drawn using horizontal and vertical lines with nodes at different points in time. Each node represents a specific task or event and is labeled with its name and the date it occurred. The timeline spans from Nov 17 2017 to Dec 12 2017. The diagram also includes two nodes that are highlighted in bold and underlined. The nodes are labeled "Submit Project Proposal" and "Finish Report" respectively, suggesting their importance in the timeline. The figure environment is commented out, indicating that it is not being used in the current code.
