The code is a LaTeX document that produces a bar chart using the `pgfplots` package and the `tikz` graphics language. The chart shows the gas limits (in units) required for the deployment of several smart contracts: ERC20, ERC721, StoreFront, Registry, and Deployer. The x-axis shows the smart contract types, and the y-axis shows the gas limits. The gas limits are represented by bars, and there are three sets of bars representing the original deployment, a deployment with efficiency improvements, and a deployment using a Deployer. The chart also includes dashed lines representing the gas limits for the Mainnet, Kovan, Ropsten, and Rinkeby networks.

The code defines several colors used in the chart, such as `mainnet`, `kovan`, `rinkeby`, and `ropsten`. The gas limits are hardcoded into the code as coordinates for each of the bars. The legend is set at the bottom of the chart, with three entries corresponding to the three sets of bars.

The code also includes comments that provide additional information, such as the gas cost estimations for deploying each smart contract on the Ethereum network with a specific gas price, and the gas limits for each network represented by the dashed lines in the chart.
