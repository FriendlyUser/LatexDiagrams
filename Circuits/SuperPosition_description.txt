This code defines a standalone LaTeX document with a TikZ environment for creating an electrical circuit diagram. It includes the necessary packages for creating circuit diagrams, using SI units, and typesetting mathematical symbols.

The circuit consists of a voltage source with a value of 4 volts connected in series to a resistor with a value of 10 ohms. The voltage at the top of the resistor is connected to a controlled voltage source with a voltage of 3 times the voltage between nodes a and b. The bottom of the controlled voltage source is connected to a current source with a value of 2 amperes. Nodes a and b are connected to the top and bottom of the circuit respectively. An open circuit element with a label of Vab is added to the right of the circuit to represent the voltage between nodes a and b.
