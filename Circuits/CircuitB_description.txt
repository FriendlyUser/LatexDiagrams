This is a complete LaTeX document with a document class of `standalone`. It includes the packages `amsmath`, `amsthm`, and `tikz`. The `tikz` package is used to draw a block diagram of a control system. The diagram is drawn using the `tikzpicture` environment within a `standalone` documentclass. The different elements of the control system are represented by nodes of different shapes and styles, such as `input`, `sum`, `controller`, `block`, and `output`, and are positioned using the `positioning` library. The arrows between the nodes represent the flow of signals between them and are specified using the `draw` command with the `->` option to indicate the direction of the arrow. The text labels for the arrows are specified using the `node` command with appropriate positioning options. The diagram also includes some mathematical expressions specified in the node text using `$` delimiters.
