This is a complete LaTeX document with a document class of `standalone`. It includes the packages `circuitikz`, `siunitx`, `amsmath`, and `amssymb`. The `circuitikz` package is used to draw an electronic circuit diagram. The circuit consists of two voltage sources, two resistors, and a current source connected in a circuit. The diagram is drawn using the `circuitikz` environment within a `tikz` environment. The nodes in the circuit are connected using the `to` command, and various options are specified for the circuit elements using different parameters. The circuit elements include resistors (`R`), voltage sources (`V`), and a current source (`I`). Labels for the circuit elements are specified using `$` delimiters, and various parameters like `i>` and `l^=` are used to customize the appearance of the circuit elements. The `siunitx` package is used to typeset units and quantities with correct spacing and formatting.
