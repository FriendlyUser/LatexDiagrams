The LaTeX code above uses the `smartdiagram` package and the `tikz` package to create a connected constellation diagram. The `planet` and `satellite` styles are defined with a regular polygon shape with six sides. The diagram is created using the `\smartdiagram` command, which takes the `connected constellation diagram` option to specify the type of diagram to create. The diagram consists of seven nodes representing steps to build a Dapp, with each node connected to the next by an arrow. The nodes are labeled with text split across two lines, and some nodes have a forward slash to split the text into two parts. The `connection planet satellite` style is used to draw the arrow connections between nodes in the shape of a hexagon with a color that is defined by the color scheme used by the `smartdiagram` package.
